https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial

factorial(5) = 1*2*3*4*5 = 120

Example:
> factorial(5)
120

Version 1
- validate n argument according to the factorial requirements (check wikipedia)
- use for loop with range from 1 to n (included!)
- multiple the consecutive numbers by each other and return the value

Tests
Check several values based on the wikipedia table.
