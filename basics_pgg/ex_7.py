Write a program that, based on the playerâ€™s position (x, y) on the board
in the range from 0 to 100,
displays its approximate location (center, upper right corner, upper edge, ...)
or information about the position outside the board. Take the value 10 as an edge margin.

Sample program output:
Enter player's X position: 95
Enter player's Y position: 95
The player is in the upper right corner.
