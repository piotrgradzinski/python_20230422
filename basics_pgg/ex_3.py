"""
Write a program that calculates the cost of travel from city A to city B
based on the number of kilometers given by the user, the price of fuel
and fuel consumption. Ask the user for the cities names.

Use a proportion formula to calculate this:
cost = distance * fuel_consumption / 100.0 * price
cost = 420 * 5.5 / 100.0 * 4.55

Sample program input:
City A: Warsaw
City B: Gdańsk
Distance Warsaw-Gdansk: 420
Fuel price for 1l: 4.55
Fuel consumption per 100 km: 5.5

Sample program output:
The cost of the Warsaw-Gdańsk journey is 105.11 PLN
