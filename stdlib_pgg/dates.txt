The first battle on *Belgian* territory was the siege of Liege from 1914-10-05 to 1914-10-09. After the fall of Liege, most of the Belgian forces made a retreat towards Antwerp and Namur. The *German troops* in their march into France bypassed the Belgian army, which, however, now posed a serious threat to their wing, for which reason the city of Namur was besieged by the Germans from 1914-10-20 to 1914-10-23.
